    <h2 class="greenify">Wither</h2>
        <p>
            The wither is one of the most infamous bosses in Minecraft. It can be created by the player on the Overworld, End, and the Nether. The wither shoots wither skeleton skulls at you and when it hits, it damages you and gives you the wither effect wherein it damages you every second until you die in game. Although if you beat the wither, it rewards you with a Nether Star. You can then use this nether star to craft beacons and End Crystals. The items you need to summon the Wither is are:
            <ul class="greenify">
                <li>
                    3x Wither Skeleton Skull
                </li>
                <li>
                    4x Soul Sand
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After collecting the needed materials. Place the soul sand in a T shape and place the 3 wither skeleton skull on top of the soul sand.
        </p>
    <h2 class="greenify">Ender Dragon</h2>
        <p>
            The Ender Dragon is the most challenging boss in the game because it requires you to destroy the End Crystals once you enter the End through the End Portal. The dragon knocks players in the air when it gets close enough to them and breathes sort of fire/dragon's breath at the players and if the players are inside those particles, they will take damage. You need atmost 12 eye of ender which can be made with blaze powder and ender pearls.
